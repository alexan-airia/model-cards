  Here's a **redline analysis** of the provided Consulting Services Agreement based on the **Contract Review Playbook**:

  ---

  ## 1. Party Definition

  **Always check for clearly defined parties, ensuring full legal names and addresses are provided.**

  **Analysis**: The agreement satisfies this requirement by clearly defining the parties in the preamble.

  ## 2. Liability Clauses

  **Review liability clauses to ensure our client's exposure is limited and capped where possible.**

  **Excerpt**:

  9.2 EXCEPT FOR BREACHES OF SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY) OR SECTION 6 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE CONSULTANT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

  **Suggested Improvement**:

  9.2 EXCEPT FOR BREACHES OF SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY) OR SECTION 6 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE CONSULTANT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IN THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

  **Reason**: Reducing the liability cap to six months aligns with the playbook's guideline to limit our client's exposure.

  ## 3. Termination Conditions

  **Verify that termination conditions are balanced and provide our client with sufficient flexibility to exit the agreement if needed.**

  **Excerpt**:

  2.2 Termination for Convenience. Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Party.

  **Suggested Improvement**:

  2.2 Termination for Convenience. The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Consultant. The Consultant may terminate this Agreement without cause upon sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the Company.

  **Reason**: This change provides the Company (our client) with more flexibility, aligning with the playbook's guideline.

  ## 4. Payment Terms

  **Examine payment terms for clarity, fairness, and alignment with industry standards. Ensure late payment penalties are reasonable.**

  **Excerpt**:

  3.2 Invoicing and Payment. The Consultant shall submit monthly invoices to the Company detailing the Services performed and hours worked. The Company shall pay all undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of each invoice.

  **Suggested Improvement**:

  3.2 Invoicing and Payment. The Consultant shall submit monthly invoices to the Company detailing the Services performed and hours worked. The Company shall pay all undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of each invoice. Any amounts not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of 1% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less.

  **Reason**: Adding a reasonable late payment penalty aligns with the playbook's guideline.

  ## 5. Confidentiality Provisions

  **Analysis**: The confidentiality provisions in Section 5 are comprehensive and align with the playbook's guideline.

  ## 6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

  **Confirm that the governing law and jurisdiction align with our client's preferences, typically favoring their home state or a neutral venue.**
